### Version Control
Version control also known as source control or revision control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It involves systematically tracking and managing changes made to software code and files over time. Version control systems are essential tools that assist software teams in overseeing modifications throughout the development process. As developers make edits, the system captures snapshots of the files, preserving them permanently for future reference. This systematic approach enhances team efficiency.
